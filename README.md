# Symbol-mind

formally assisted thinking environment

---

## About

A small, humane, calm, **symbolic computing environment** where someone can think more clearly and program things that matter to them.

Not a product nor a platform. More like a **thought interface**. A modern day Lisp, Forth, or Metamath used to formally deduce reliable facts.

A place where someone can sit, write a bit of symbolic code, **express ideas cleanly**, and feel their mind come back into focus.

The **ideas may be documented** and stored for later reflections.

## The Seed

In a world where the majority chases beautiful but complex graphical interfaces, a **small oasis of simplicity and minimalism** arises.

No graphical user interface, only text mode. No millions of colors, only a monochrome tint. Following this setup, the **balanced structure** emerges behind.

We intentionally trade the visual decoration for **clarity of meaning**. Here, unambiguous expressions and transparent interpretation carry the weight that, otherwise, is given to the graphical appearance.

From this seed, and without unnecessary features, we bring the Symbol-mind into existence.

## The Fruits

A lot of intellectual tasks could be performed by Symbol-mind using provided tools to formalize and simplify argumented choosing the right options among a variety of alternatives.

The uses of Symbol-mind may involve any kinds of formalizations such as **fact checking and producing**, **tasks planning and optimization**, or **theory verifying and proving**.

Symbol-mind intention is to serve as a **truth validation medium** assisting in identifying the right facts for solving the right tasks.
